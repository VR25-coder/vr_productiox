    "description": " I am a freelance cinematographer and video editor, passionate about creating powerful visual stories that connect with audiences. From concept development and shooting supervision to editing, color grading, motion graphics, and finishing, I specialize in transforming raw footage into compelling narratives. I’ve worked on diverse projects, blending artistic storytelling with technical precision, and I believe every frame has the power to leave a lasting impact.\n\nAlongside my creative work, I am also pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at G.H. Raisoni College of Engineering (GHRCE), with a growing interest in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and system administration. Currently, I’m gaining hands-on experience in content creation and video production through my part-time role at Entrance Zone (Vatsala Academic).\n\nWhile my primary passion lies in filmmaking and editing, my background in technology and cybersecurity gives me a unique perspective — enabling me to approach projects with creativity, precision, and problem-solving skills.\n",
