    "intro": "I'm a cinematographer and video editor focused on cinematic commercials, documentary narratives and digital-first campaigns.",
    "description": "I help brands, institutions and creators turn raw footage into clear, emotionally driven stories. From look development and pacing to colour and sound, I care a lot about how each cut feels and how the overall film supports the message.\n\nAlongside client work, I'm pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at G.H. Raisoni College of Engineering (GHRCE). That technical background in areas such as cybersecurity and systems helps me bring structure, reliability and problem‑solving to every project. I also work part-time as a Video Editor at Entrance Zone (Vatsala Academic), where I manage end-to-end production for education-focused content at scale.\n\nWhether it's a commercial, documentary piece or social campaign, my goal is to deliver films that feel polished, intentional and true to the story we are trying to tell.\n",
